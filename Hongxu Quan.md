## 1. Introduction

This video is divided into four parts: Introduction, Kinesis, Postman and Swagger operation demonstration.

First, it gives my understanding of the REST API and explains why the Kinesis proxy is used.

## 2. Kinesis

For this part, I refer to this [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/integrating-api-with-aws-services-kinesis.html). However, I have made the following changes:

- Add PUT method. 

- Change POST method properties. 

- Change GET method parameters.

## 3. Postman

This part shows how to test the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE methods above, and explains the meaning of each status code.

## 4. Swagger

This part shows how to generate yaml format documents for the above REST API, how to import files into swagger, how to add methods and tests.The shared document is [my-rak](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/lwkua007/my-rak/1).
